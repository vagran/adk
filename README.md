# Application Development Kit

This is a small helper library I use for developping my hobby C++ projects. It uses own build system based on
[SCons](http://http://www.scons.org). Main target platforms are Linux desktops and AVR microcontrollers. Also it
has own C++ unit testing framework and some useful application components implementation. More documentation is
available in `doc` folder in [DokuWiki](http://https://www.dokuwiki.org) format.
