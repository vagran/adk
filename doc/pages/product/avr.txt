====== Development for AVR MCUs ======

See [[adk:product:basic_usage|"Basic usage"]] page for AVR target specific variables and AVR-specific make targets.

===== AVRISP programmer =====

AVRISP programmer use FTDI USB<=>Serial bridge chip:
<code>
Bus 003 Device 002: ID 0403:6001 Future Technology Devices International, Ltd FT232 USB-Serial (UART) IC
</code>
Corresponding driver is present by default in Ubuntu 12.10 so that after the programmer attach, the serial device is created as ''/dev/ttyUSB0''. However the device is in group "dialout" so the required user should added to this group.

==== Persistent name ====

Persistent name can be created for the programmer to make more convenient usage. Check vendor ID, product ID and device serial number in ''dmesg'' output. After that create file ''/etc/udev/rules.d/99-avrisp.rules'' with the following content:
<file bash 99-avrisp.rules>
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403", ATTRS{idProduct}=="6001", ATTRS{serial}=="A900a4mN", SYMLINK+="avrisp"
</file>
==== Uploading firmware ====

//See [[adk:product:basic_usage|"Basic usage"]] page for AVR-specific make targets for firmware management.//

Use "avrdude" with the following options:
<code bash>
avrdude -P /dev/avrisp -c avrisp2 -p <your_part_name,e.g. attiny2313>
</code>
