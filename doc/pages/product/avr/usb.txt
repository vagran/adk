====== USB software implementation ======

AVR support library in ADK has software implementation for USB interface. For simplicity only 20MHz crystal configuration is supported. Also tight timings allow only low-speed function implementation with some limitations. The library provides one two-directional pipe between host software and embedded application. It is working on top of control endpoint 0, using custom vendor-specific control requests. Endpoint maximal packet size is set to 8 bytes. For simplicity other endpoints and transfer types are not supported. One configuration is provided. The application is abstracted from the USB endpoints, transfer types and configurations concept. It sees only two-direction communication pipe (like socket) and can implement any application level protocol on top of it.

===== USB driver state machine =====

This state machine is used in the library.

<uml>

[*] --> POWERED: [Power on]

POWERED: Skip all packets.

POWERED --> LISTEN: [RESET]\nCall reset handler
ANY_STATE --> LISTEN: [RESET]\nCall reset handler
ANY_STATE --> LISTEN: [Unknown PID]\nReset RX_MINE
ANY_STATE --> ANY_STATE: [Other address in token]\nReset RX_MINE

LISTEN: Skip all except tokens.
LISTEN: When token is seen, check address.
LISTEN: If address is mine and one of state-exiting tokens, set RX_MINE.

LISTEN --> SETUP: [SETUP]

SETUP --> SETUP: [DATA0, RX_SETUP not set]\nReceive in buffer,\nsend ACK,\nset RX_SETUP

SETUP --> SETUP: [IN]\nSend NAK

SETUP --> SETUP: [OUT]\nSet RX_MINE

SETUP --> SETUP: [DATA0/DATA1, RX_SETUP set]\nSend NAK

SETUP --> WRITE_DATA: [H2D request processed]\nFree buffer,\nreset RX_SETUP

WRITE_DATA --> WRITE_DATA: [OUT]\nSet RX_MINE

WRITE_DATA --> WRITE_DATA: [DATA0/DATA1]\nReceive in buffer if data toggled,\ndo not occupy buffer if not.\nReset RX_MINE.\nSend ACK or NAK.

WRITE_DATA --> WRITE_STATUS: [IN]\nSet RX_MINE,\nsend status

WRITE_DATA --> LISTEN: [IN, request error]\nReset RX_MINE,\nsend STALL

WRITE_STATUS --> WRITE_STATUS: [IN]\nSet RX_MINE,\nsend status

WRITE_STATUS --> LISTEN: [IN, request error]\nReset RX_MINE,\nsend STALL

WRITE_STATUS --> LISTEN: [ACK]\nReset RX_MINE

SETUP --> READ_DATA: [D2H request processed]\nFree buffer,\nreset RX_SETUP

READ_DATA --> READ_DATA: [IN, no data ready]\nSend NAK

READ_DATA --> READ_DATA: [IN, data ready]\nSet RX_MINE,\nsend DATA1/DATA0

READ_DATA --> READ_DATA: [ACK, have more data]\nReset RX_MINE,\ntoggle data ID,\nfree transmission buffer

READ_DATA --> READ_DATA: [ACK, no more data, last size 8]\nReset RX_MINE,\ntoggle data ID,\nfree transmission buffer,\nsend empty data

READ_DATA --> READ_STATUS: [ACK, no more data]\nFree transmission buffer

READ_STATUS --> READ_STATUS: [OUT]\nSet RX_MINE

READ_STATUS --> LISTEN: [DATA1]\nReset RX_MINE,\nsend ACK

READ_STATUS --> READ_STATUS: [NAK]\nReset RX_MINE

READ_STATUS --> LISTEN: [STALL]\nReset RX_MINE

</uml>

When "Send status" action is mentioned it means the following:
  * Send empty DATA1 packet if the request successfully processed.
  * Send NAK if the request was not yet processed.
  * Send STALL if the request failed or invalid.

Data ID toggling is not verified in write requests.

Abbreviations:
  * H2D -- host-to-device direction ''bmRequestType'' field of setup data.
  * D2H -- device-to-host direction ''bmRequestType'' field of setup data.
